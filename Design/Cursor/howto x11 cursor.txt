To create x11 cursor files create a cursor configuration file.
This file should contain the following:

dimension pointer-position-x pointer-position-y image-filename
e.g.:
24 2 2 cursor.png

then call this command to create a x11 cursor named cursor.x11
xcursorgen cursor.conf ./cursor.x11

On windows systmems you can simply use the ico file format. Though with that
you'll be limited as you can't set the pointer possition. To get more control
you have to use windows cursor (cur or ani) files.
